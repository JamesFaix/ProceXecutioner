# ProceXecutioner

## A word of caution:
ProceXecutioner is an experimental application for killing Windows processes in bulk.  For example, it can be used to clean up background processes that stay running long after an application closes or software update checkers that are unnecessary 99% of the time.  It can also do a lot of damage, such as closing files without saving, killing an active web server, or angering a system administrator.  Do not use this program.  But if you do, use it carefully.
